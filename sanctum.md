## Your Library Sanctum
The heart of your adventure is your library, which is also your home. Choosing a type of library grants you a permanent ability that enhances certain Atmospheric Buffs. For any buff listed in your chosen library's description, you now earn x2 Ink Drops whenever that buff would normally provide an Ink Drop bonus.

### The Spire of Whispers
Rising endlessly into the clouds, this vast tower is filled with spiral staircases and high, arched windows. Whispers of half-read stories drift through the air, a chorus of encouragement and warning. It is a place of quiet study, candlelight, and the comfort of hearthfire.
**Associated Buffs:** Candle-lit Study, Cozy Hearth, Head in the Clouds

### The Verdant Athenaeum
Nestled within an enchanted forest, this living library sprawls with vines, glowing blossoms, and winding paths. Birds flit through the rafters, and every step seems to awaken the rustle of leaves eager to share their secrets. Here, wisdom is nurtured in the embrace of nature itself.
**Associated Buffs:** Herbalist's Nook, Soaking in Nature, Soundscape Spire

### The Sunken Archives
Buried beneath dunes of shifting sand, this ancient library is a labyrinth of collapsed halls and half-submerged chambers. Scrolls crumble into dust, guarded by spectral archivists who watch intruders with owl-like intensity, reminiscent of Wan Shi Tong's eternal vigilance. The air is thick with the weight of forgotten knowledge, daring you to unearth it.
**Associated Buffs:** Soundscape Spire, Wanderer's Path, Excavation
