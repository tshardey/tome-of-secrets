## The Core Gameplay Loop
Your journey through the Grand Library unfolds in a steady rhythm of discovery, choice, and reading. Each month, follow this loop to guide your adventure:

1.  **Draw All Cards:** Begin by drawing the cards for your Monthly Quest Pool.
2.  **Roll for Challenges:** For each card, roll the appropriate dice to reveal the challenges and quests that await.
3.  **Determine Your Loadout:** Select the magical items and companions you will equip for this cycle to best meet the quests ahead.
4.  **Pick Your Books:** Choose the books you will read for each prompt. You may use the same book to satisfy multiple prompts unless a prompt specifically forbids it.
5.  **Read and Earn:** Read the books to complete your quests, earning Ink Drops, Paper Scraps, XP, magical rewards, and Dusty Blueprints.
6.  **Restore the Library (Optional but Recommended):** Spend Dusty Blueprints on **Restoration Projects** in the [Library Restoration]({{ site.baseurl }}/library.html) page to unlock Display/Adoption slots and permanent wing bonuses.
7.  **Face the Shroud if Needed:** If you do not complete all quests, consult The Shroud's Curse to resolve any consequences.

This loop forms the beating heart of your adventure, carrying you from month to month as you preserve the magic of the Grand Library.

## The Monthly Quest Pool
At the start of each month, you will establish your Quest Pool. This determines how many books you are committed to reading. You can choose to:

* **Set Your Number:** Simply decide on the number of books you want to read.
* **Roll for Your Number:** For added randomness, roll a die to determine your pool size. For example, a single d4 would give you a pool of 1-4 quests.
* **Dice Pool:** Roll multiple dice and combine the results. The average of these rolls can help you decide how many quests to take on. The average of a single d6 is 3.5, and the average of two d6s is 7.

Once your pool is set, you will draw that many cards from a standard playing card or tarot deck. Each card will determine a quest you must complete.

*Note: Dungeon rooms typically result in two book prompts—one for the room's challenge and one for the encounter—so plan your quest pool with that in mind.*

## The Card Draw
Each card suit corresponds to a specific type of challenge or quest.

* **Hearts ♥ (d6):** Roll a d6 for an Organize the Stacks quest.
* **Diamonds ♦ (d8):** Roll a d8 for an Atmospheric Buff.
* **Clubs ♣ (d8):** Roll a d8 for a Side Quest.
* **Spades ♠ (d12):** Roll a d12 for a Dungeon Crawl.

*Optional Rule: At the start of each month, before drawing cards, you may always roll once for an Atmospheric Buff. This ensures that you always have the option to include at least one immersive effect in your reading journey, even if you do not draw any Diamonds.*

**Re-rolling Completed Quests:** If you roll a number for a dungeon room or side quest that you have already completed (marked with a checkmark in the tables), you may roll again. For dungeon rooms, you may also opt to complete the other encounter if you have only completed one of the room's encounters.

## Currencies and Progression
There are three primary currencies that define your progress, plus a fourth for character advancement.

* **XP (Experience Points):** Your XP is for character progression and leveling up.

    **Earn XP for:**
    *  Completing any book (+15 XP, calculated at end of month)
    *  Completing an *Organize the Stacks* quest (+15 XP, awarded immediately)
    *  Completing monsters in a *Dungeon Room* (+30 XP, awarded immediately) 
* **Ink Drops:** The primary currency for in-game rewards and essential for creating books.  Use them to purchase in-game items, buffs, and to help create new books.

    **Earn Ink Drops by:**
    *  Completing any book (base of 10 *Ink Drops*)
    *  Completing an *Organize the Stacks* quest (+10 *Ink Drops*)
    *  Triggering *Atmospheric Buffs*
    *  Completing *Side Quests*
    *  Coming across *Friendly Creatures* in a *Dungeon Room*
* **Paper Scraps:** Earned from specific quests and activities, such as journaling about a book or your adventures in the library. Use them, in conjunction with Ink Drops, to "create" a new book to add to your collection.

    **Earn Paper Scraps for the following:**
    *  Reading books outside of your quest pool (+10 *Paper Scraps*)
    *  Completing adventure journal entries (+5 *Paper Scraps*)
    *  Taming a *Familiar* in a *Dungeon Room* (+5 *Paper Scraps*)

* **Dusty Blueprints:** A special currency used for **Library Restoration**. Spend Dusty Blueprints to complete Restoration Projects, which unlock **Display Slots** (passive item slots), **Adoption Slots** (passive familiar slots), and wing completion bonuses.

    **Earn Dusty Blueprints for:**
    * Completing **Genre Quests**
    * Completing **Extra Credit** challenges

    **Spend Dusty Blueprints on:**
    * Restoration Projects in [Library Restoration]({{ site.baseurl }}/library.html)

## Keeper's Loadout
As a Keeper, you have three starting item slots: one Wearable, one Non-Wearable, and one Familiar. You can only equip one item per slot at a time. The Familiar slot is filled when you befriend a familiar in a dungeon. As you level up, you can unlock more item slots. This loadout lets you tailor your approach each month, adding strategy to how you tackle quests and challenges.

## The Keeper's Journal (Optional Rule)

While The Tome of Secrets can be played as a simple tracker of reading prompts, it shines brightest as a Solo Journaling Game.

### What is a Journaling Game?

A journaling game is a role-playing experience played alone, where the "gameplay" consists of writing entries in a diary or logbook from the perspective of your character. Instead of just ticking a checkbox that says "Quest Complete," you write a few sentences (or paragraphs) describing how your Keeper completed that quest.

**Earn Paper Scraps:** Completing a journal entry for any quest grants you +5 Paper Scraps.

### How to Connect Your Reads

The core creative challenge is tying the Real World Book you read to the In-Game Quest you faced. This connection doesn't always have to be literal. The Grand Library is a place where stories bleed into reality.

Consider these different ways your book might manifest in your journal:

* **The Literal Object:** You physically pull the book from your satchel. Key items referenced in the book might show up in your library.
* **The Environmental Echo:** The setting of your book overlays the Library. Reading a snowy thriller? The room you enter is inexplicably freezing, covered in frost, or snowing indoors.
* **The Manifestation:** Elements of the book come to life. A character from the book appears as a ghost or NPC. A mural on the wall depicts the book's plot as if it were ancient history.
* **The Vibe:** The tone of the book dictates the mood. A horror novel might make the shadows in the Library lengthen and whisper.
