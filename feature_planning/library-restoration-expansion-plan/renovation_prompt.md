# Context
I am ready to start planning for my next expansion.  Unfortunately, I had gone through the trouble with another LLM to get it most of the way flushed out only to lose my work.  I was hoping you could instead help me prepare for the next phase of the game.  I don't want to write any code yet.  I just want to get the content portion of the game correct before worrying about implementation.  I would like to do it in the same repo as the game to avoid losing important artificats going forward. 

# New Expansion
The current expansion is Library Restoration: 
This is mostly a cozy game and getting to restore and bring life back into the library fights with that vibe
- Each of the Dungeon rooms are part of one of the wings, as thematically appropriate
- There should be 5-6 wings
- Each wing will be centered around a specific set of genres or moods
-- Historical/memoirs/philosophy/non-fiction
-- Romance/Contemorary/Drama
-- Sci-fi/science
-- Fantasy/Romantasy
-- Horror/mystery/thriller/crime

We will add appropriately themed dungeon rooms so that each wing has 3-4 rooms.  Once all of the rooms in a wing have been completed then you can begin renovating the wing. The total dungeon rooms should not exceed a d20 for the time-being.  

## Renovation
Each wing will start out with 2-3 restoration projects.  These should focus on improving the bones of each of the wings.  This will be expanding upon in the future.  

Genre quests will now give a currency that can be used towards restoration projects.  Something along the lines of blueprints.

Each restoration project should cost an amount of dusty blue prints.  It will result in either a passive non-wearable item slot or a passive familiar slot

Restoration projects will consist of a prompt that needs to be completed on top of the paid currency.  

## Changes to items

Non-wearable items and familiars will now have a less powerful passive bonus. 

# Other Info
Please ask questions or clarification when necessary.  
It is important to thing about prompt diversity.
It is important to think about theming and consistency.  Monsters and creatures should make sense in the room that their in and the room should make sense in the wing. 
Balance should be in line with the base game.
