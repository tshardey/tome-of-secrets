# Library Restoration Expansion - Comprehensive Plan

## Overview

The Library Restoration expansion transforms the dungeon crawling experience by organizing all rooms into thematic wings based on genre and mood. Players earn a new currency (Dusty Blueprints) from genre quests to fund restoration projects that bring life back to the abandoned library, unlocking powerful passive bonuses.

### Core Concepts

- **20 Dungeon Rooms** organized into **5 Wings** (plus 1 special central area)
- **Wings** are unlocked for restoration once all their rooms are completed
- **Restoration Projects** cost Dusty Blueprints and grant passive item/familiar slots
- **Wing Completion Bonuses** reward players who fully restore each wing
- **Heart of the Library** - A special 6th area accessible from the start

## Item System: Active vs Passive Bonuses

With the Library Restoration expansion adding many new passive item/familiar slots, we need to differentiate between equipped (active) items and passive slot items to maintain balance.

### How It Works

**Active (Equipped) Bonus**: Full power when the item is equipped in your active wearable/familiar slot
**Passive (Room Slot) Bonus**: Half power when placed in a passive restoration slot

This allows players to benefit from more items as they complete restoration projects, without making wearable slots obsolete.

### Existing Non-Wearable Items - Add Passive Bonuses

Update [`allItems.json`](assets/data/allItems.json) to include both active and passive bonuses:

| Item Name | Active Bonus (Equipped) | Passive Bonus (Room Slot) |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Bookwyrm's Scale | +10 Ink Drops (500+ pages) | +5 Ink Drops (500+ pages) |
| Key of the Archive | +15 Ink Drops (unlocking) | +8 Ink Drops (unlocking) |
| Tome of Potential | x3 multiplier (400+ pages) | x1.5 multiplier (400+ pages) |
| Librarian's Quill | +2 Paper Scraps (journaling) | +1 Paper Scraps (journaling) |
| Gilded Painting | +2 Ink Drops (ornate location) | +1 Ink Drops (ornate location) |

### Existing Familiars - Add Passive Bonuses

| Familiar Name | Active Bonus (Equipped) | Passive Bonus (Room Slot) |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Pocket Dragon | +20 Ink Drops (fantasy series) | +10 Ink Drops (fantasy series) |
| Garden Gnome | +2 Ink Drops (reading outside/plants) | +1 Ink Drops (reading outside/plants) |
| Mystical Moth | +2 Ink Drops (reading by lamplight) | +1 Ink Drops (reading by lamplight) |
| Page Sprite | x2 multiplier (<300 pages) | x1.5 multiplier (<300 pages) |

### Utility Items - Add Passive Versions

Items with special abilities need weaker passive alternatives:

| Item Name | Active Ability (Equipped) | Passive Ability (Room Slot) |
|-----------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Chalice of Restoration | Once per month, remove a Worn Page penalty | Once every 2 months, remove a Worn Page penalty |
| Lantern of Foresight | Once per month, reroll prompt or die (keep new result) | Once every 2 months, reroll prompt or die |
| Scepter of Knowledge | Once per month, switch any quest to Non-Fiction | Once every 2 months, switch any quest to Non-Fiction |
| Celestial Koi Fish | Once per month, switch genre quest to opposing genre | Once every 2 months, switch genre quest to opposing genre |
| Tome-Bound Cat | x2 Ink Drop bonus on atmospheric buffs | +3 Ink Drops when using atmospheric buffs (not multiplied) |

### New Items from Restoration

All new items/familiars from restoration projects follow the same rule:
- When equipped: Moderate power (+4-5 Ink Drops, +2-3 Paper Scraps)
- In passive slot: Half power (+2-3 Ink Drops, +1-2 Paper Scraps)

### Balance Notes

- **Wearable items remain the most powerful** - they don't have a passive mode and keep their full bonuses
- **More slots = more bonuses** - As players complete restoration projects, they can stack multiple passive bonuses
- **Strategic choice** - Players must decide whether to equip an item for full power or use it passively while equipping something else
- **Progressive power** - Early game: 1-2 active slots. Late game: 1-2 active + 10-15 passive slots

---

## Design Principles

### Thematic Consistency
- **Creatures match rooms**: Horror rooms have horror creatures, romance rooms have romance creatures
- **Rooms match wings**: Each room's theme, atmosphere, and prompts align with its wing's genres
- **Restoration projects fit wing aesthetics**: Projects restore elements that make thematic sense

### Prompt Diversity
Drawing from [`TBR Expansion Ideas - Prompts.csv`](planning/ideas/TBR Expansion Ideas - Prompts.csv):
- Use varied prompt types (content-based, format-based, social reading, etc.)
- Mix specific and flexible prompts
- Include prompts for different reading habits and preferences
- Balance challenging and accessible prompts

### Game Balance
- **Passive rewards are moderate**: +3-5 Ink Drops keeps them valuable but not overpowered
- **Wearable items remain strongest**: Maintains existing hierarchy
- **Blueprint costs scale appropriately**: Players progress steadily through the year
- **Wing bonuses are significant**: Completing a wing feels like a major achievement

### Cozy Restoration Vibe
- **Bringing life back**: Projects focus on restoration, repair, and renewal
- **Positive framing**: "Restore" not "Clear debris," "Revitalize" not "Kill monsters"
- **Welcoming spaces**: Descriptions emphasize comfort, beauty, and invitation
- **Player as caretaker**: The keeper brings the library back to life through reading

### Name Simplicity
- **Direct and evocative**: "The Laboratory" over "The Chamber of Scientific Wonders"
- **Clear purpose**: Names immediately convey what the space is for
- **Atmospheric but grounded**: Magical but not overwrought

   - [`allItems.json`](assets/data/allItems.json) - Rebalance existing items

### UI/UX Considerations

- Wing progress visualization (rooms completed, restoration status)
- Blueprint currency display
- Restoration project interface
- Wing completion celebration/notification
- Passive slot management for restoration rewards

### Player State Tracking

New player data needed:
- `dustyBlueprints` (number)
- `wingsProgress` (object tracking room completion per wing)
- `restorationProjectsCompleted` (array)
- `wingsCompleted` (array)
- `passiveItemSlots` (array)
- `passiveFamiliarSlots` (array)

### Calculator Compatibility

**Critical:** All expansion changes must work with the existing XP/Ink Drops/Paper Scraps calculator:

1. **Active vs Passive Bonus System**:
   - Calculator needs dropdown/toggle for each item: "Equipped" or "Passive Slot"
   - When "Equipped": Apply full (active) bonus
   - When "Passive Slot": Apply half (passive) bonus
   - Players can have multiple items in passive slots simultaneously

2. **Wing Completion Bonuses**:
   - Add checkboxes for each wing completion
   - Apply permanent passive genre bonuses automatically when checked
   - Special unlocks (Quantum Calculator, Arcane Familiar, etc.) apply their always-active bonuses

3. **New Currency Display**:
   - Add Dusty Blueprints counter (separate from XP/Ink Drops/Paper Scraps)
   - Track blueprint gains from genre quests
   - Track blueprint spending on restoration projects

4. **Passive Slot Management**:
   - UI to show available passive item slots (earned from restoration projects)
   - UI to show available passive familiar slots (earned from restoration projects)
   - Visual indication when slots are filled vs empty

5. **Restoration Project Tracking**:
   - Checkboxes for each restoration project per wing
   - When checked: Unlock corresponding passive slot
   - Visual progress bar for wing completion

6. **New Items/Familiars**:
   - All new items from restoration need to be added to calculator dropdown
   - Each with active and passive bonus options
   - Conditional bonuses (e.g., "stars on cover", "witchy vibes") work as player-confirmed

7. **Backward Compatibility & Schema Transition**:
   - **Critical**: This expansion is FREE for all players - everyone gets it automatically
   - Existing items keep their current bonuses as "active"
   - Add new "passive" bonuses without breaking existing saves
   - Existing player data must gracefully upgrade to include new fields:
     - `dustyBlueprints: 0` (starts at 0)
     - `wingsProgress: {}` (empty object, populated as wings are discovered)
     - `restorationProjectsCompleted: []` (empty array)
     - `wingsCompleted: []` (empty array)
     - `passiveItemSlots: []` (empty array)
     - `passiveFamiliarSlots: []` (empty array)
   - **Migration Strategy**:
     - Check if player data has new fields on load
     - If missing, add them with safe defaults
     - Never break existing saves or lose player progress
     - Test thoroughly with old save files before release

## Conclusion

The Library Restoration expansion transforms the dungeon experience from a series of disconnected rooms into a cohesive narrative of restoration and renewal. Players literally rebuild the library through their reading, with each book bringing more life and light back to the forgotten halls.

The expansion respects the cozy nature of the game while adding meaningful progression systems, maintains balance with existing mechanics, and provides diverse content that appeals to readers of all genres.

**Total new content**:
- 8 new dungeon rooms
- 17 restoration projects
- 17 new passive rewards
- 6 wing completion bonuses
- 1 new currency system
- Rebalanced economy

**Estimated development time for content creation**: This is a substantial expansion that roughly doubles the dungeon content and adds a new parallel progression system.
