The Lord of the Reads II: The Two Libraries
This expansion/sequel shifts the narrative from a generic adventure to a specific journey between libraries, introducing more complex mechanics like character skills, item collections, and a D12 movement system.

Game Design & Mechanics
Goal: Travel from the Library of Undertowers (Westmarch) to the Library of Dol Amroth (Western Gondor) to deliver books you gather along the way.

Movement: Unlike the first game (which implied standard dice), this version explicitly uses a D12 (12-sided die) for movement across the map.

The Journey: The player moves from the bottom left to the top right of the map.

The "Dead Marshes": A specific hazard on the board. If you land here, special rules apply (often involving losing progress or needing specific rolls to escape).

Reward System (Collections): Instead of just finishing a list, players now complete Collections (sets of themed prompts) to earn rewards. For example:

Rings of Middle Earth: Completing this set rewards "2 Books."

Weapons and Armour: Completing this set rewards "2 Books."

Valar: A massive set rewarding "5 Books."

Storytelling: The Librarian's Quest
The narrative role-playing element is much stronger in this version. You are playing as an Assistant Librarian. The integration of story and mechanics is handled through Character Skills, which act as "power-ups" you can use during the game:

Sam (A Friendly Shoulder): Mechanic: Allows you to move one extra tile. Theme: Helping you forward when you are stuck.

Boromir (Redemption): Mechanic: Allows you to re-draw a prompt card. Theme: correcting a mistake or "folly."

Legolas (Elven Vision): Mechanic: Allows you to see the prompts on the cards before selecting. Theme: Elf eyes see far ahead.

Gimli (Digging Deep): Mechanic: +1 point for every book owned for more than a year. Theme: Dwarves value ancient things deep in the earth.

Frodo (The Bearer of the One): Mechanic: Allows you to cover two prompts with one book. Theme: Carrying the ultimate burden covers all others.

Aragorn (King's Blessing): Mechanic: Gives a chance to beat the "Dead Marshes" tile without penalty.

Unique Prompts & Concepts
This version leans heavily into "Lore" names for the prompts. Instead of generic instructions, the prompt cards are named after items, people, or events from Middle Earth:

"Second Breakfast": Read the second book in a series.

"Riddle of Strider": Read a book based on a true story.

"Mûmakil": A book over 300 pages with a title starting with 'M'.

"Sting" (Weapon): Read a short book (referencing Bilbo's small sword).

"The Eye of Sauron": A book with mostly orange on the cover.

"Ent Draught": Read a book with a drink on the cover.

"Grond": Read a book with a "hard hitting" plot (referencing the battering ram).

"Shelob's Lair": Read a book with a plot twist (referencing the trap/web).
