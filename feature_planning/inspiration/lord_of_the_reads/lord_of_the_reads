The Lord of the Reads: Game Summary
"The Lord of the Reads" is a free, fan-made board game inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings. It is designed to gamify the process of selecting a monthly reading list (TBR).

Game Design & Mechanics
Goal: To curate a monthly reading list by moving around a board and completing specific reading prompts.

Setup: The game requires two six-sided dice, the game board, prompt cards, and the missions document.

The TBR Number: At the start of the month, the player chooses a "TBR number" (e.g., 5 books). This number dictates how many times they roll the dice to populate their reading list.

Movement: Players roll the dice and move counter-clockwise around the board.

The "Jars": To keep selections random and varied, the rules suggest preparing three specific jars (or digital pickers):

TBR Jar: Books the player explicitly wants to read that year.

Bookshelf Jar: Unread books currently owned (excluding the "TBR Jar" picks).

Series Jar: Unfinished series the player has started.

Penalty System: If a player fails to read the selected books during the month, those unread books carry over to the next month's list.

Storytelling: The Fellowship of the Read
The narrative element is integrated through "Mission Cards." Landing on a Mission tile triggers a challenge to unlock a member of the Fellowship. Each mission uses a quote from the books to thematically link the character's lore to a specific reading task.

The Missions
Sam (The Most Loyal Friend):

Theme: Sharing a burden with a friend.

Task: Read a book that was a gift.

Boromir (The Weakness of Men):

Theme: Redemption after giving in to weakness.

Task: Finish a book you previously DNF'd (Did Not Finish).

Gimli (Mining the Darkest Depths):

Theme: Digging into the past.

Task: Read a "TBR Veteran" (a book that has been on your list for a long time).

Aragorn (Return of the King):

Theme: The return of a hero.

Task: Re-read the first book you ever loved.

Frodo (Walking the Darkest Path):

Theme: Carrying a heavy burden on a dark path.

Task: Read the lowest-rated book on your TBR.

Completing all missions allows the player to "Assemble the Fellowship" and grant themselves a real-life reward.

Unique Prompts & Concepts
The game includes creative prompts found in the cards and missions that differ from standard genre challenges:

Legolas ("The Truest Aim"): Pick a book with your eyes closed (referencing looking inward when lost).

Merry ("The Bravery of the Small"): Read the first published work of a favorite author (acknowledging great things start small).

Physical Attributes:

"A book with a cover the same colour as your shirt."

"Your prettiest book."

"A book with natural elements on the cover."

Subjective Challenges:

"A book outside of your comfort zone."

"A book you bought for the cover."

The Series Jar Win Condition: The rules include a humorous nod to readers with too many open series: if a player finishes every series they have started, they are declared "better than 99% of the reading humanity" and are allowed to start a new one.
