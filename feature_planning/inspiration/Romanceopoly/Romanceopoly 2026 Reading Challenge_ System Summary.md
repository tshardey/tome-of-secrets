# **Romanceopoly 2026 Reading Challenge: System Summary**

**Theme:** Romanceopoly University (Romanceopoly U)

**Goal:** "Graduate" by earning credits through reading specific romance sub-genres.

**Total Books Required:** 20 (Base Game)

## **1\. The Core System: Your Degree Plan**

To graduate, you must complete **20 prompts (classes)**. The structure is customizable based on which genres you prefer.

### **The Breakdown**

* **5 Core Curriculum Classes:** Mandatory prompts for everyone. These are the baseline requirements.  
* **5 Major Classes:** You choose one primary Department (genre) to focus on.  
* **5 Minor Classes:** You choose a secondary Department.  
* **5 Electives:** You cherry-pick single prompts from any of the remaining departments you *did not* choose as a Major or Minor.

## **2\. The Departments (Genres)**

The board is divided into "buildings," each representing a specific sub-genre.

* **Romantic Arts:** Contemporary romance (banter, meet-cutes, fake dating, workplace tension, small towns).  
* **Paranormal Studies:** Vampires, shifters, ghosts, demons, fated mates.  
* **Fantasy Theory:** Romantasy, fae courts, royalty, portals/multiverse, warlords.  
* **Historical Studies:** Dukes, Highlanders, time travel, rebellious heroines.  
* **Dark Psychology:** Dark romance, gothic tension, obsession, morally gray characters.

## **3\. Game Mechanics & Rules**

### **Navigation Styles**

* **Planner Mode:** Choose your path (Major/Minor) ahead of time and read through the specific lists in order.  
* **Chaos Mode:** Roll dice to move your token around the campus map to determine your next read based on where you land.

### **Rules**

* **"Double Dipping":** Allowed. You can use a single book to satisfy multiple prompts (e.g., a book that fits both a Core Class and a Major requirement).  
* **Transfers:** You are allowed to DNF (Did Not Finish) books and swap them out. You can also change your Major or Minor mid-year if your reading mood shifts.
