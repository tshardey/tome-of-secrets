## **1\. Onboarding & Setup: The "Play-to-Create" Approach**

*Koriko* is notable for its refusal to front-load heavy mechanics. It uses a specific pedagogical approach to ease non-gamers and writers into the experience without "stat block paralysis."

### **Volume I: Departure (The Tutorial Phase)**

The first "Volume" of the game acts as an extended prologue. It introduces the player to the narrative voice and the act of journaling before introducing the stress of the dice mechanics.

* **The "Curse of Perfection":** The very first instruction asks the player to intentionally mar their pristine new journal—smudge it, scribble a typo, or make a messy mark.  
  * *Design Intent:* This psychological trick lowers the barrier to entry, giving the player permission to be imperfect and focus on flow rather than aesthetics.  
* **"Mad Libs" Character Creation:** Instead of assigning points, the player fills in the blanks of a pre-written paragraph using evocative lists.  
  * *Identity:* Name (e.g., "Birch"), Look (e.g., "careworn eyes"), Style (e.g., "moss-covered knitwear").  
  * *The Familiar:* The animal companion is established immediately (e.g., a "sassy skink" or "dozy rat").  
  * *Self-Perception:* Defining how the village sees the witch vs. how they see themselves.  
* **Anchoring the Stakes:** Before leaving, the player defines the relationship with their Mentor and the specific "Drive" for leaving (e.g., "to prove my mentor right" vs. "to chill out and be a teenager").  
* **The Journey (World Building Transition):**  
  * The transition from Village to City is handled via rolling tables (d6) rather than cards.  
  * Players roll for travel encounters (e.g., meeting another witch mid-air).  
  * **The Approach:** The player chooses how they approach the city (e.g., "Guided by nature" or "Drawn to the buzz"), effectively generating the setting's aesthetic before they "land."

## **2\. The Core Engine: Mechanics**

### **A. The Tarot System (Content Generation)**

The deck is split into two functional distinct categories:

1. **Minor Arcana (Moments):** These represent daily events, jobs, and occurrences.  
   * *Wands:* Ambition & Expression.  
   * *Cups:* Community & Tradition.  
   * *Swords:* Influence & Conflict.  
   * *Coins:* Work & Wealth.  
2. **Major Arcana (Confidants):** Specific NPC archetypes (e.g., The Fool, The Emperor) that form the social web of the game.

### **B. The Volume Deck (Pacing Control)**

Players do not draw from the full deck randomly. The game is broken into 7 Volumes (Prologue, Arrival, 4 Seasons, Epilogue).

* **Setting Intentions:** At the start of a season, the player constructs a small **Volume Deck** (7-9 cards).  
* **Deck Construction:** The player chooses specific Suits and specific Confidants to add to the deck based on the narrative focus they desire for that season.  
* *Design Intent:* This ensures the player encounters the specific NPCs they want to develop relationships with, preventing narrative "bloat."

### **C. Dice Stacking (Resolution & Tension)**

Instead of rolling for success, the game uses a **Dice Stacking** mechanic (Jenga-style) to represent rising tension.

* **The Trigger:** Stacking is required when a prompt is inherently "Risky" or when the player chooses a "Risky Twist."  
* **Inverse Difficulty Scaling:** The number of dice to stack is determined by the witch's proficiency in a Skill (Power, Craft, Care, Lore).  
  * **Low Skill (\<3 Lessons):** Stack 3 dice (Hard).  
  * **High Skill (6+ Lessons):** Stack 1 die (Easy).  
* **The Collapse:** If the tower falls, it triggers a **Consequence** table based on the numbers showing on the fallen dice. The tower is then cleared, resetting the physical tension.

## **3\. Character & World Progression**

### **Skills & Lessons**

Character stats are qualitative, not quantitative.

* **Skills:** Power, Craft, Care, Lore.  
* **Progression:** When a risky action is successful, the player writes a one-sentence "Lesson" under that skill (e.g., "I learned to soothe the spirits of the old clock tower").  
* *Design Intent:* The character sheet becomes a diary of memories, not just numbers.

### **The City Map (Tones)**

The player draws an abstract map divided into quadrants matching the Tarot suits.

* **Tones:** When meeting new Confidants, the player selects "Tones" (sensory details, locations, vibes) to add to specific map quadrants.  
* *Function:* These serve as a "word bank" for future writing prompts.

## **4\. Narrative Architecture**

### **The Confidant System (NPC Engine)**

* **The Circle:** The player maintains a "Circle" of known NPCs.  
* **The Arc Structure:**  
  1. **Meeting:** First draw of the Major Arcana card. Tones added to map.  
  2. **Hangouts:** Subsequent draws. Standard interaction prompts.  
  3. **Crossroads:** Unlocked after 3 Hangouts. A pivotal, binary choice event that resolves the NPC's arc (often involving a choice to help them change or stay the same).  
* **Judgement (The Mentor):** A special NPC who cannot be "hung out" with in the traditional sense. They intervene during failure states, preventing a tower collapse but denying the player the XP (Lesson) they would have gained.

### **The Macro Structure (The Year)**

1. **Departure:** Prologue / Setup.  
2. **Arrival:** Establishing the city.  
3. **Spring:** Growth and new beginnings.  
4. **Summer:** High energy, longer volume (more cards).  
5. **Autumn:** Reflection, letting go (emphasis on removing cards/NPCs).  
6. **Winter:** Hardship, slower pace (fewer cards).  
7. **Year's End:** The final decision (Stay, Leave, or Move On).

### **The Micro Loop (Within a Volume)**

1. **Draw Card:** Reveal Moment (Minor) or Confidant (Major).  
2. **Select Twist:** Choose a prompt modifier from a 4x4 grid (e.g., "A warm welcome" or "Genuinely scary"). Some are marked **Risky**.  
3. **Bonuses:** Completing a row/column on the Twist grid unlocks bonuses (e.g., "Free Lesson," "Remove Dice").  
4. **Resolve:** Write the journal entry. If Risky, stack dice.  
5. **End Phase:** Rest (real-time meditation) \-\> Write a Letter Home (Synthesis of events).

## **5\. Design Takeaways for LLM/Game Designers**

* **Physicality of Tension:** Using a physical tower adds a tactile element to the "magic" that simple RNG rolling lacks. It mirrors the precariousness of teenage independence.  
* **Prompt Vagueness:** Prompts are designed to be "Magical Realism" compatible. They rarely define *what* the magic looks like, leaving that to the player's imagination (e.g., "You have begun to hoard something. What?").  
* **Safe Failure:** Failure (Tower Collapse) rarely results in death. It results in embarrassment, broken items, or social friction—fitting the cozy genre.  
* **Pacing Control:** By allowing the player to build the "Volume Deck" every season, the game prevents the randomness of a 78-card deck from derailing the specific story the player wants to tell.
