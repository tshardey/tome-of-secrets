## ♠️ Dungeon Rooms (Roll a d12 )
Roll a d12 to determine your dungeon room. Each room offers a narrative challenge and encounter. Complete both to earn the rewards for the room. Complete all dungeon rooms to be able to roll on the <a href="#dungeon-completion-rewards">Dungeon Completion Rewards</a> table.

**Note:** If you roll a dungeon room that you have already completed (grayed out in the table below), you may roll again. Alternatively, if you have only completed one encounter in a room, you may opt to complete the other encounter instead of re-rolling.
