title: The Shroud's Curse
---

The Shroud creeps like spilled ink through the stacks, feeding on unread stories. Each missed quest gives it strength, curling around your shelves like a choking fog. To fall too far behind is to risk losing not only the tales but the magic that binds them together.

If you fail to complete your monthly quest pool, the Shroud advances, and you receive a Worn Page penalty for each book you missed. For each Worn Page you have, roll on the Curse Table at the start of your next month's quest.

1.  **The Unread Tome:** A neglected book groans from your shelf. You must read a book from your DNF list or one you have been putting off.
2.  **The Lost Lore:** Pages crumble to dust before your eyes. You must read or listen to a non-fiction book or podcast related to science, tech, or nature.
3.  **The Forgotten Pages:** Dusty shelves collapse, scattering volumes into chaos. You must reorganize a section of your physical books or digital library.
4.  **The Ravenous Shadow:** The Shroud claws hungrily at your stack. You must take on one additional quest for your monthly pool.

**Removing Worn Page Debuffs:** You may banish one Worn Page by completing either a dungeon or 1d4 quests. If you triumph and complete all your quests in a month, the Shroud recoils in defeatâ€”you may remove all Worn Page debuffs.
