title: The Shroud's Curse
---

The Shroud creeps like spilled ink through the stacks, feeding on unread stories. Each missed quest gives it strength, curling around your shelves like a choking fog. To fall too far behind is to risk losing not only the tales but the magic that binds them together.

**Journaling Prompt:** How does the Shroud manifest in your sanctum? Is it a creeping fog, a whispering silence, a thorny vine, or something else entirely? What kind of sensations does it evoke when it's near.

If you fail to complete your monthly quest pool, the Shroud advances, and you receive a Worn Page penalty for each book you missed. For each Worn Page you have, roll on the Curse Table at the start of your next month's quest.

**Removing Worn Page Debuffs:** You may banish one Worn Page by completing either a dungeon or 1d4 quests. If you triumph and complete all your quests in a month, the Shroud recoils in defeatâ€”you may remove all Worn Page debuffs.
