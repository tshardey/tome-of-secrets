## Character Creation: Your Magical School
Every Keeper draws power from a magical school, which grants them unique abilities to aid in their quests. Choose one of the following to be your primary specialization. This choice gives you a powerful, permanent benefit for your journey.

### School of Abjuration
Cloaked in shimmering wards and whispered mantras of guardianship, Abjurers dedicate themselves to shielding the Grand Library from the Shroud. Their studies echo with protective charms etched into the very stones of their sanctums.

**Benefit:** Once per month, when you would gain a Worn Page penalty, you may instead draw a card from the deck and choose a quest from that draw to complete.

### School of Divination
Keepers of Divination peer into pools of ink and read the shimmer of futures hidden within the margins. Their foresight is prized, for they glimpse truths beyond the turning of a page.

**Benefit:** Once per month, you may roll 2 dice instead of 1 for a Monthly Quest, and choose which result you want to use.

### School of Evocation
Sparks dance from their fingertips as Evokers study in fire-lit halls, conjuring storms and flame from words alone. Their passion for raw power blazes with every tale they consume.

**Benefit:** Once per month, when battling a monster in a dungeon, you may choose to defeat it quickly by reading a short story or novella instead of a novel.

### School of Enchantment
With soft voices and subtle gestures, Enchanters weave influence not only over wandering spirits but over the books themselves, coaxing stories to reveal their hidden depths.

**Benefit:** When you befriend a monster in a dungeon, you earn 1.5x the base XP for that quest.

### School of Conjuration
Conjurers summon echoes of beings and places from other times, filling their sanctums with flickering companions and phantom libraries. Their craft ensures no story is ever truly lost.

**Benefit:** When you complete a quest while your Familiar slot is equipped, you gain an additional +5 Ink Drops for each quest.

### School of Transmutation
Focuses on the arcane art of alchemy, allowing the Keeper to shift the essence and value of their collected resources. You master the rare skill of converting one material into another, understanding that the value of ink and paper is fluid.

**Benefit:** Once per month, you may transmute your currency. You can exchange 5 Ink Drops for 1 Paper Scrap, or 1 Paper Scrap for 5 Ink Drops.
