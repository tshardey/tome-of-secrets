## Character Creation: Your Keeper Background

Before you were a Keeper, you were... something else. This background represents your life before dedicating yourself to the Grand Library, and it grants you a small, permanent benefit born from your past experiences.

> **Journaling Prompt:** Where does your Keeper come from? What event or calling led them to this life of protecting the Grand Library?

### The Scribe's Acolyte

You spent your formative years copying manuscripts and illuminating texts. Your fingers are permanently stained with ink, but your understanding of the written word is profound.

**Benefit:** Gain a permanent +3 Paper Scrap bonus every time you complete an Adventure Journal entry.

### The Archivist's Apprentice

You were raised in the dust of history, cataloging artifacts and sorting brittle scrolls. You have an innate sense for separating fact from fiction and finding the truth in old lore.

**Benefit:** Gain a +10 Ink Drop bonus any time you complete a quest by reading a book from the **Non-Fiction** or **Historical Fiction** genres.

### The Cartographer's Guild

You were trained to map the unknown, to chart the stars, and to find paths where none existed. The twisting, shifting halls of the Grand Library feel like a challenge, not a threat.

**Benefit:** The first time you begin a Dungeon Crawl (draw a ♠) each month, you automatically gain +10 Ink Drops for mapping the territory.

### The Cloistered Prophet

You lived a life of quiet contemplation, dedicated to the old gods of knowledge and narrative. You see omens in the Shroud and hear whispers from the lost stories.

**Benefit:** Gain a +10 Ink Drop bonus any time you complete a quest by reading a book with a **religious, spiritual, or mythological premise**.

### The Biblioslinker

You used to "liberate" rare books from private collections. You know how to get into places you're not supposed to be and find things that are meant to stay hidden.

**Benefit:** You know how to find the good stuff. Gain a permanent +3 Paper Scrap bonus every time you successfully complete a Dungeon Crawl (♠).

### The Grove Tender

You tended one of the last living gardens, cultivating stories from seeds and roots. You understand the natural, creeping decay of the Shroud and how life persists.

**Benefit:** Your connection to the natural world is constant. You always have **The Soaking in Nature** atmospheric buff active, earning +1 Ink Drop per day you read (or +2 Ink Drops per day if you chose The Verdant Athenaeum as your sanctum).

## Character Creation: Your Magical School
Every Keeper draws power from a magical school, which grants them unique abilities to aid in their quests. Choose one of the following to be your primary specialization. This choice gives you a powerful, permanent benefit for your journey.

> **Journaling Prompt:** How did you come to study this school of magic? Were you formally trained, or did you stumble upon its secrets? What about it calls to you?

### School of Abjuration
Cloaked in shimmering wards and whispered mantras of guardianship, Abjurers dedicate themselves to shielding the Grand Library from the Shroud. Their studies echo with protective charms etched into the very stones of their sanctums.

**Benefit:** Once per month, when you would gain a Worn Page penalty, you may instead draw a card from the deck and choose a quest from that draw to complete.

### School of Divination
Keepers of Divination peer into pools of ink and read the shimmer of futures hidden within the margins. Their foresight is prized, for they glimpse truths beyond the turning of a page.

**Benefit:** Once per month, you may roll 2 dice instead of 1 for a Monthly Quest, and choose which result you want to use.

### School of Evocation
Sparks dance from their fingertips as Evokers study in fire-lit halls, conjuring storms and flame from words alone. Their passion for raw power blazes with every tale they consume.

**Benefit:** Once per month, when battling a monster in a dungeon, you may choose to defeat it quickly by reading a short story or novella instead of a novel.

### School of Enchantment
With soft voices and subtle gestures, Enchanters weave influence not only over wandering spirits but over the books themselves, coaxing stories to reveal their hidden depths.

**Benefit:** When you befriend a monster in a dungeon, you earn 1.5x the base XP for that quest.

### School of Conjuration
Conjurers summon echoes of beings and places from other times, filling their sanctums with flickering companions and phantom libraries. Their craft ensures no story is ever truly lost.

**Benefit:** When you complete a quest while your Familiar slot is equipped, you gain an additional +5 Ink Drops for each quest.

### School of Transmutation
Focuses on the arcane art of alchemy, allowing the Keeper to shift the essence and value of their collected resources. You master the rare skill of converting one material into another, understanding that the value of ink and paper is fluid.

**Benefit:** Once per month, you may transmute your currency. You can exchange 5 Ink Drops for 1 Paper Scrap, or 1 Paper Scrap for 5 Ink Drops.
