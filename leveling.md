## Permanent Bonuses
As you level up, you unlock the following permanent abilities at the specified levels.

| Level | Permanent Bonus Unlocked                                                                                              |
|:-----:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3     | **Atmospheric Forecaster:** Before drawing your Monthly Quest Pool, you may roll for one additional Atmospheric Bonus and choose which one to apply (or none). |
| 6     | **Novice's Focus:** You gain an additional +5 XP for every book completed that is 300 pages or more.                        |
| 7     | **Focused Atmosphere:** All positive Ink Drop bonuses granted by an active Atmospheric Bonus are increased by +1 (usually resulting in a +2 bonus). |
| 9     | **Insightful Draw:** When drawing your Monthly Quest Pool, you draw one extra quest card and then discard one card of your choice. |

## School Mastery Abilities
Use a School Mastery Point (SMP) to acquire a new, permanent ability from your chosen school. Once you have acquired both abilities from your primary school, you may spend future SMPs to acquire the first ability (costing 1 SMP) from any other Magical School (Multiclassing).

### School of Abjuration: Wards and Guardianship
Abjurers are the ultimate protectors, specializing in preventing and removing the negative effects of the Shroud's Curse.

| Ability Name | Cost | Benefit |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Ward Against the Shroud** | 1 SMP | Once per month, when you would gain a Worn Page penalty for an uncompleted quest, you may choose to completely negate it. The penalty is never applied. |
| **Grand Dispelling** | 2 SMP | Once per month, you may perform a powerful cleansing ritual. Remove all active Worn Page penalties you currently have. This ability is a potent reset after a particularly challenging month. |

### School of Divination: Foresight and Truth
Diviners bend fate to their will, manipulating the randomness of quests and challenges to create their preferred path.

| Ability Name | Cost | Benefit |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Flicker of Prophecy** | 1 SMP | When rolling a d6 for a Genre Quest, you may choose to treat the result as one number higher or lower (e.g., a 2 can become a 1 or a 3). This cannot be used to turn a 1 into a 6 or vice versa. |
| **Master of Fates** | 2 SMP | Once per month, when establishing your Monthly Quest Pool, you may draw two additional cards from your deck. You then look at all the cards drawn and choose which ones to keep for your final quest pool, discarding the rest. |

### School of Evocation: Raw Power and Action
The Evoker is a master of the swift and decisive blow, channeling immense energy through short, potent forms.

| Ability Name | Cost | Benefit |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Quick Shot** | 1 SMP | The benefit of Evocation may now be used to complete any single dungeon room challenge with a short story, not just a monster encounter. This ability remains usable once per month. |
| **Concussive Blast** | 2 SMP | When you use your Evocation benefit to complete a dungeon room challenge, the blast of power is so great it also completes a second prompt in the same room (if one exists). You read one short story and satisfy two prompts at once. |

### School of Enchantment: Influence and Charm
Enchanters master the art of influence, charming creatures and coaxing stories to yield greater rewards.

| Ability Name | Cost | Benefit |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Silver Tongue** | 1 SMP | When you complete a Side Quest, you gain an additional +5 Paper Scraps, representing your knack for getting a little extra out of every interaction. |
| **Irresistible Charm** | 2 SMP | Once per month, when you encounter a monster that can be befriended, you may choose to automatically succeed at befriending it without needing to read a book for the "befriend" prompt. You must still read a book for the room's main challenge. |

### School of Conjuration: Companions and Echoes
Conjurers have a deep bond with magical companions, enhancing their abilities and even summoning more than one to their side.

| Ability Name | Cost | Benefit |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Empowered Bond** | 1 SMP | Your connection to your companions intensifies. The Ink Drop or Paper Scrap bonus granted by your equipped Familiar is permanently increased by +5. |
| **Echo Chamber** | 2 SMP | You have mastered the art of magical connection. You permanently unlock an additional Familiar slot on top of any Familiar slots you have already unlocked. |

### School of Transmutation: Alchemy and Transformation
Transmuters are masters of conversion, finding value where others see none and transforming one resource into another with arcane skill.

| Ability Name | Cost | Benefit |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| **Alchemic Focus** | 1 SMP | You gain an additional +5 XP for every book you read outside of your monthly quest pool (e.g., book club reads, mood reads). You have learned to transmute recreational reading into tangible progress. |
| **Philosopher's Stone** | 2 SMP | Once per month, you may sacrifice 50 XP to instantly create resources from arcane energy, gaining 50 Ink Drops and 10 Paper Scraps. This allows you to convert character progression directly into currency when needed.
