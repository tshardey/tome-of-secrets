# The Tome of Secrets: A Solo TBR Adventure

Welcome, Keeper, to the Grand Library, a repository of all stories. Your sacred duty is to ensure the tales are read and the magic they hold is preserved. For too long, an unread shadow known as the "Shroud" has crept through the archives, threatening to consume the very pages of your To Be Read list. Your journey as a Keeper begins now, an adventure to save the books and restore the Grand Library to its former glory.
